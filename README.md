Repository for working on project for subject Informatika : designing a web application for group management 

Process:
  
-  4/4: Public the github root and general description of the project
- 10/4 First iteration of the project: Able to show groups and member as well as changing group name
- 16/4 Second iteration: opting for cleaner look and better function representation 
- 17/4 Project Day 1. Web page is currently cappable of showing groups or members card based on ID search bar and tranfer between groups and sub groups
  
Possible improvement:
+ More functional search bar : return result based on name or goal
+ Changes to data using redux store
