Process:

-  4/4: Public the github root and general description of the project
- 10/4 First iteration of the project: Able to show groups and member as well as changing group name
- 16/4 Second iteration: opting for cleaner look and better function representation 
- 17/4 Project Day 1. Web page is currently cappable of showing groups or members card based on ID search bar and tranfer between groups and sub groups
- 3/5 : Due to data  fetched from server has different format and attributes, we had to deleted the orginal code and use parts of it to make the new better suited code
- 4/5: Redux store and dispatch actions was used inside to store data ( at the time imported from file ) and reducers for possible buttons was added
- 6/5: Successfully fetch data from server GQL and put in the store. All future references will be collected from store
- 8/5: Roles are fetched into store to make option menu select role for each member

Possible improvement:
+ More functional search bar : return result based on name or goal
+ Changes to data using redux store
